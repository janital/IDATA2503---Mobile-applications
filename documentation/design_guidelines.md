# Design guideline

<br>

### Theme

The design should be minimalistic and sleek, with soft edges to make it less serious and harsh.

<br>

### Color scheme

The colors used for the design will be primarily white and black to follow the minimalistic and sleek feel. A selection of other colors will be used for various buttons and images throughout the app.

<br>

### Hierarchy and layout

The most important function of the app will be project and tasks and they will be prominent in the app. Widgets for navigating to project and task
will be the most important elements.
Projectpage will have tabscreen, and have a grid with list tiles for project, tasklist will have list items to create a visual difference between the screens.

<br>

### Images

We don't plan to use images for the app, but users can add a profile image.

<br>

### Icons

https://phosphoricons.com/ will be used for icons in the app.

<br>

### Typography

A sans serif font will be used to give a modern, minimalistic and sleek design to the app.
The font will also be rounded to make the design less hard.
The font chosen is [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?subset=vietnamese&preview.text=Super%20test&preview.text_type=custom&query=Comfortaa).

<br>

### Border rounding

Edges in the app should not be round nor hard, only a soft bend in corners.

<br>

### Shadows

Shadows in the app should be small and soft.
